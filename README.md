Solidity Concert Ticket Smart Contract
I am a huge classical music fan and one of my favorite pianist is Evgeny Kissin. I created a smart contract about selling tickets,
it is structured like this:

- Only 100 tickets available
- Price for one ticket is 0.36 Ether
- Customer pays by registering with name and age
- Refund is possible (allow owner to use a button to delete customer of the list, if for example the customer contacted, and the
  price gets transacted back to the customer)
- Customers under the age of 25 get a discount for 0.14 Ether
- There is a button for “tickets left”, so people know if it is sold out or not
- Only the owner can get the information (like the name) of the customers listed
- Owner can withdraw the money from the tickets
- Contract can be destroyed (usefull for example if it only sells 95 tickets, and people cannot buy a ticket on accident if they
  didn’t realize the concert is already over)
